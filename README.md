## About us

<br>
We are inter-earthlings. To solve the project we made a friendly story for children as a book, and the book is in PDF format, audio-video format, and a hard copy format. The book is very easy to understand for children, and all the scientific ideas and theories are very simplified to make every child able to understand and enjoy it! The challenge is telling Parker solar probe's story to the youth generation. This story contains a scientific theme, and complicated scientific information about the sun and venus and the probe. This book has solved completely the challenge, by telling this story in a very simplified and enjoyable way. The children are the future. We need to raise their awareness

## The project 


<br>
The project is a book, not just a simple book, but a book which the children will take as a first step in their scientific journey. They can have the hard copy version, as they can listen to the audio or download the PDF version. All these versions will help the child choose his/her best learning method. Some children love hearing, and others love reading from devices as having a hard copy book.

## The Experience 🏆

Unforgettable moments. We met new friends. We loved workshops and challenges like robotic challenges. Just WOW. I got a great team. I will never forget the solidarity moments and the stressful moments, and the great moments when we were having fun. I will never forget my teammates. We learned how to manage how to be problem solvers, how to be flexible and accept any idea from the teammates.
